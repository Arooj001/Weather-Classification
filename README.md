"I'm excited to share the completion of my latest project: a weather classification dataset using image classification techniques! üå¶Ô∏èüì∏

I connected with Kaggle to access a diverse collection of weather images. I organized the dataset by creating separate folders for training and validation data. I also visualized the training folder to understand the distribution of different weather categories.

To improve the dataset, I used data augmentation techniques to create more variations of the images. Then, I created a weather classification model using deep learning. I trained the model for 30 epochs to help it learn patterns in the data.

During training, I monitored the accuracy and loss of the model on both the training and validation data. This helped me understand how well the model was performing. After training, I tested the model on a separate test dataset to evaluate its performance.

To ensure the data was labeled correctly, I checked a sample of the data. I also used a confusion matrix to assess how accurate the model's predictions were.

I'm proud of what I've accomplished in this project, combining my passion for data analysis, image classification, and weather. I'm sharing this on LinkedIn to inspire others and show the power of data-driven insights in weather analysis.
